# What is Styled-System And Why Should I Use It

---

# What is it

"Collection of utility functions that add style props to your React components and allows you to control styles based on global theme constants or design tokens" - styled-system

- Requires a CSS-in-JS library such as styled-components or emotion
- Pushes you to use a global theme
- Use utility functions to style your UI
- Create responsive styling via array or object

---

## Three Tenets of styled-system

**1.** Style consistently with a global theme

**2.** Respond to changing requirements quickly

**3.** Create mobile-first responsive layouts with ease

```notes
  - Ask people about their experiences?
  - Using SASS / CSS variables (not
  available in all browsers) allows a theme
  - Do people think theme first when
  designing an application?
```

# Using a global theme

- What are my design tokens?
- What does spacing look like? (margin + padding)
- Typography
- Breakpoints
- Borders
- Colors
- etc...

```notes
Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes.
We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
  - Use your design tokens to setup the theme file
  - How the theme relates to
  the utility functions
  - Typography: font family, font size, font weight, text transform
```

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
export const theme = {
  breakpoints: [600, 900, 1200, 1800],
  space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512],
  fontSizes: [12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 80, 96],
  fontWeights: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900],
  letterSpacings: {
    normal: "normal",
    heading: "0.1em"
  },
  fonts: {
    serif: "athelas, georgia, times, serif"
  },
  borders: ["2px solid", "4px solid"],
  colors: {
    black: "#000",
    "light-gray": "#eee",
    "near-white": "#f4f4f4",
    white: "#fff"
  }
  // ...and so on
}
```

# Utility functions

- space & color (and more!)
- variant, style, compose

```notes
  - space is composed of margin + padding, top, bottom, left, right, x axis and y axis
  - color is for color and background-color (bg)
  - Relate back to theme
  - Component API allows us to respond to changing requirements quickly
  - Talk about variant, style and compose with
  examples.
  - Variant and style is how we can combine styles from our theme
```

---

# space & color

---

```jsx
import { space, color } from 'styled-system'

const Box = styled.div`
  ${space}
  ${color}
`

// space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512],

// margin: 8px
// padding: 32px
<Box m={2} p={4} bg='black' color='grayLight'>
  {children}
</Box>

<Box py={2}  mx={1} bg='blue' color='text'>
  {children}
</Box>

```

---

# variant function

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// somewhere in theme.js
buttonStyles: {
  primary: {
    color: colors.white,
    backgroundColor: colors.blue,
    border: borders[0],
  }
}

import { variant } from "styled-system"
const btnStyles = variant({ key: "buttonStyles"})

const Button = styled.button`
  ${btnStyles}
`

<Button variant='primary'>
  OK
</Button>
```

---

# style function

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// from documentation...
const fontSize = style({
  // React prop name and CSS property
  prop: "fontSize",
  // CSS property (if different from prop argument)
  cssProperty: "fontSize",
  // key for theme values
  key: "fontSizes",
  // accessor function for transforming the value
  transformValue: n => n + "px",
  // add a fallback scale object or array, if theme is not present
  scale: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32],
  // Optional prop alias
  alias: "ffffontSizzzee"
})
const Text = styled.div`
  ${fontSize}
`
const SomeComponent = props => <Text fontSize={3}>Hello</Text>
const SomeComponent = props => <Text ffffontSizzzee={1}>Hello</Text>
```

---

# compose function

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
// style/utils.js
import {
  compose,
  fontFamily,
  fontSize,
  fontWeight,
  lineHeight,
  color
} from "styled-system"
export const typography = compose(
  fontFamily,
  fontSize,
  fontWeight,
  lineHeight,
  color
)
// text.js
import { typography } from "style/utils"

const Text = styled.div`
  ${typography}
`
```

---

# Responsive styling

- Defined by the breakpoints property in your theme file
- Defaults to px but you can change the unit type

```notes
  - How weird is it to use arrays? At first object seems sensible
  but arrays are much nicer once you use them
  - Using object properties are frowned upon (why?_ check docs)
  - Greay for font-size, margin, padding, and width.
```

---

export default QuoteLayout

```jsx
const breakpoints = [
  600,
  900,
  1200,
  1800,
]
// aliases
breakpoints.sm = breakpoints[0]
breakpoints.md = breakpoints[1]
breakpoints.lg = breakpoints[2]
breakpoints.xl = breakpoints[3]

<Box
  width={[
    1,    // 100% width below the smallest breakpoint
    1/2,  // 50% from the next breakpoint and up
    1/4   // 25% from the next breakpoint and up
  ]}
/>
<Box width={{ sm: 1, md: 1/2, lg: 1/4 }} />
```

```notes
You can change the unit of the breakpoint
```

# Why should I use styled-system?

- Consistency
- Easy
- Maintainability
- GitHub's Primer Components

```notes
During code review you don't know the style of each component.
With s-s you know exactly what you are getting
Show an example of styled system with variants, responsive design vs regular css in js
```
